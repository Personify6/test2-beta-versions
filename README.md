Welcome to the beta versions of Test2. Here, there are experimental features for the next update. Just be careful since there may be a lot of bugs on these versions. Currently, Test2 1.7 is under development and the release date of it is currently unknown. Also, sometimes I may just lose interest in developing this website, so there is a possibility of month-long periods with no updates.

# It has been decided that there will be five beta versions and a release candidate.
